# TCP Hello Server

A simple TCP server written in Go that listens on port `8080` and sends a friendly message to any client that connects. This is a minimal example demonstrating how to use Go's `net` package to accept TCP connections, write responses, and handle basic I/O.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

Upon running the server:
- It opens a TCP listener on `localhost:8080`
```
go run main.go
```
- Accepts incoming client connections (e.g., via `telnet` or `nc`)
```
nc localhost 8080
```
